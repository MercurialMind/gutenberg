## Sketch

If you prefer to use [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), the [SketchPress](https://github.com/10up/SketchPress) project includes a library of Gutenberg design components helpful for designing and prototyping:

[Download Sketch mockups & patterns files](https://github.com/10up/SketchPress)

These components are built to be used in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) for Mac. Users on other platforms may have luck importing the file to [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (Mac/Windows/Linux) or [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy) (Windows).

Please note that these are mockups, so they may not be 1:1 accurate. It is also possible that the Sketch files aren’t up to date with the latest version of Gutenberg itself, as development sometimes moves faster than the Sketch updates.

If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to ask in the #design channel on the WordPress community Slack.
